# tmux

## Purpose
This repo contains my configuration setup for tmux. I am keeping it in this repo for a few reasons:

1. In order to keep my tmux configuration settings consistent across machines I use. If I make an improvement anywhere, it takes effect everywhere.
2. So that anyone who knows tmux productivity better than I do (a great many people) can suggest improvements.
3. In the hope that my own humble setup might prove helpful to someone else trying to improve their own productivity in turn.

## Organization
Right now, my configuration is simple enough to reside in a single file: `.tmux.conf`
